1. The loopback filesystem driver can be used to mount a file to be used as a hard disk image. this can be very useful for mounting
	CD or DVD images as filesystems as well as for simulating or learning about various types of filesystems.
2. creating a file to use for the image and filled with zeros.

dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/fsimage bs=1024 count=204800

3. then create an ext3 filesystem on it with:
	
mkfs.ext3 /tmp/fsimage

4. then mount it(as root) with
sudo mkdir /tmp/mnt
sudo mount -o loop /tmp/fsimage /tmp/mnt

5. we can verify its mounting and check capacity with:
	
df /tmp/mnt
df -T /tmp/mnt
6. we can create files, read and write them and then unmount using 
sudo umount /tmp/mnt and such files will be survived and then remount in any location.

7. we can do this activity with other filesystem types if we have kernel support for them( cat /proc/filesystems) and appropriate
	tool for formatting such as mkfs.ext4 or mkfs.vfat
