1. Pipes permit processes to exchange streams of data, not just short signals. These processes may either be independent or have
	a parent-child relationship.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2. A process may also use a pipe to receive input from or direct output to a command.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
3. using std io , we can use functions like popen and pclose to open and close a pipe.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
4. popen() initiates a process by creating a pipe, forking and invoking the shell , using the system() call so it has the 
	same considerations as system().
	the mode argument is the same as that used in fopen(). however it can take only r or w,the pipe is not bidirectional.
	it can only be open solely for reading or solely for writing.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
5. popen returns a normal I/O stream except it must be closed with pclose() and not fclose().
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
6. pclose waits for the associated process to terminate and returns the exit status of the command.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
7. The lower level pipe() creates pipe which can be used to pass data between two processes, without the overhead of invoking 
	a shell and gives more control.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
8. using pipe() , a parent and child may be connected or a process may even connect to itself.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
9. The pipe has a read end and a write end; filedes[1] is for data write, filedes[0]  is for data read, data is processed in
	a first-in , first-out(FIFO) basis.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
10. we are using file desc after pipe so read and write will work not fread , fwrite.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
11. How pipes work differ from one UNIX variant to another.In system V , the pipes are full-duplex; both descriptors can have 
	reads and writes. in the POSIX std , each process must close one end of the pipe before using the other.
	under Linux, while the communication in each pipe is only one way. no close operation is required. keep these 
	considerations in mind for writing portable code.
